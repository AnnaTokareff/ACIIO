# **Self-Prompt Refinement via Actor-Critic Paradigm**  
**Automated Instruction Optimization for Large Language Models**  

## **Overview**  
This project introduces **Actor-Critic Iterative Instruction Optimization (ACIIO)**, an approach that enhances **prompt quality and output performance** using two LLMs:  
- **Actor** – Generates outputs.  
- **Critic** – Evaluates and refines prompts iteratively.  

Tested on **three NLP tasks**:  
- **Dialogue Summarization** – Evaluates accuracy, conciseness, coherence, etc.  
- **Lyrics Translation** – Assesses semantic accuracy, musicality, poetic quality, BLEU, BERTScore, and Rhythm Similarity.  
- **Code Generation** – Analyzes correctness, efficiency, readability, and complexity.  

## **Future Directions**  
- Fine-tuning critic scoring for **better adaptability**.  
- Exploring actor-critic methods for **creative AI applications**.  
- Investigating **prompt optimization** for structured tasks.  

## **Acknowledgments**  
Inspired by [**Self-Refine**](https://github.com/madaan/self-refine.git) and [**PACE**](https://arxiv.org/html/2308.10088v2), but developed **entirely from scratch** with new methodologies and architectures.
